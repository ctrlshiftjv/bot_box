# Bot Box
A Robot Simulator.

## Requirements
* 

## Concept
In order to make sure that the Bot Box handles changing requirements, I have made it a tabletop-centric design. The relationship will most likely not be one robot in a multiple tabletop, but instead a tabletop may have multiple robots in the future. This way, it will be more open to changes in behavior.

## Features
*

## Enhancement
* The table top dimensions can be adjusted freely.
* A GUI can be called to see how the Robot moves.
* The number of Robots can be scaled.
